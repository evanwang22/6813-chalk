        Today, we read a story on the origin of Corn: "Long ago, two braves were sitting by a fire, roasting a deer they had killed. Just then, a beautiful woman was seen to descend from the clouds and alight upon the earth. They were astonished at seeing her, and concluded that she must be hungry, and had smelt the meat. They immediately went to her, taking with them a piece of the roasted venison. They presented it to her and she ate her fill. She told them to return to the spot where she was sitting, at the end of one year, and they would find a reward for their kindness and generosity. She then ascended to the clouds, and disappeared. The two men returned to their village, and explained to the nation what they had seen, done, and heard but were laughed at by their people. When the time arrived for them to visit this consecrated ground where they were to find a reward for their attention to the beautiful woman of the clouds, they went with a large party, and found, where her right hand had rested on the ground, corn growing -and where the left hand had rested, beans - and immediately where she had been seated, tobacco. The two first have, ever since, been cultivated by our people, as our principal provisions and the last used for smoking."
