        Today, we simulated the behavior of bees in a hive. We took turns being worker bees,
        nurse bees, baby bees (larvae, a new vocab), and the queen bee! The worker bees would 
        go out and collect nectar (popcorn in our case!) and the nurse bees feed nectar to the
        larvae. The queen bee is also pampered by the worker bees and nurse bees, and her job,
        we studied, is just to sit and lay eggs all day! All in all, it was a very busy BEE day!
